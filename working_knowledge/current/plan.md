# Plan

## Active Plan

### 18.1. Add the persistent Task lifecycle foundation
- objective: introduce the Task aggregate and its four-phase lifecycle foundation without yet changing ACP prompt behavior; the canonical order was finalized by 18.2 as analysis, planning, execution, review.
- status: complete
- files: src-tauri/src/storage.rs; src-tauri/src/commands.rs; src-tauri/src/lib.rs.
- affected units: ProjectStore migration; TaskInfo and TaskPhaseInfo storage contracts; create_task; list_project_tasks; task lookup and row mapping; Tauri command registration.
- expected changes: persist tasks linked to a project and transcript session; create the four canonical phases atomically; validate project/session ownership, non-empty prompts, supported phases, and one task per transcript; expose create/list commands.
- acceptance criteria: a valid task stores its original prompt and four ordered pending phases; duplicate transcript linkage, missing/cross-project references, and empty prompt fail; listing is project-scoped and stable; existing storage data migrates safely.
- required tests: success creation/listing; canonical phase order; empty prompt; missing project/session; cross-project transcript; duplicate transcript; migration regression through the existing in-memory store setup.
- review status: passed in cycle 1; atomic persistence, ownership, uniqueness, cascade behavior, deterministic ordering, API scope, regressions, complexity, and warning-free compilation were checked with no remaining issue.
- commit: 2cfde08

### 18.2. Activate the Task lifecycle from the first ACP prompt
- objective: correct the knowledge-building order to analysis, planning, execution, review, then make the first prompt in a project-owned ACP transcript create and bind the Task while subsequent prompts reuse it.
- status: complete
- files: src-tauri/src/storage.rs; src/App.tsx; src/App.test.tsx.
- affected units: TASK_PHASES and create_task defaults; frontend Task types and transcript-indexed Task state; project refresh; createTranscriptSession; sendAcpPrompt.
- expected changes: start new Tasks in analysis; load project Tasks; create the Task before recording/sending the first prompt; retain it by transcript id; reuse it for follow-up prompts; keep transcript events storing the unmodified user prompt; preserve the existing project-less ACP smoke path outside the Task workflow.
- acceptance criteria: project-owned first prompt creates exactly one analysis-first Task; later prompts in the same transcript do not create another; a new transcript has no stale Task binding; Task creation failure prevents transcript recording and ACP send; the original prompt remains unchanged in transcript storage while only the ACP payload may contain attached manual knowledge.
- required tests: canonical analysis-first order; first prompt creation; repeated prompt reuse; failure handling; new-session isolation; original prompt versus enriched ACP payload regression.
- review status: passed after 2 cycles; cycle 1 found and fixed stale project Task-load overwrite and project-owned sending without a persisted transcript; cycle 2 found no remaining lifecycle, isolation, prompt-integrity, regression, complexity, security, or performance issue.
- commit: a6181df

### 18.2.1. Commit active Task lifecycle knowledge
- objective: reconcile and commit the post-implementation knowledge state for completed Task lifecycle items 18.1 and 18.2.
- status: complete
- files: LOCAL_PROGRESS.md; working_knowledge/current/status.md; working_knowledge/current/plan.md; working_knowledge/current/open_questions.md; working_knowledge/current/decisions.md; working_knowledge/current/handoff.md; working_knowledge/current/repo-code-buddy.md; working_knowledge/current/mind_map.md; working_knowledge/current/mind_map/task-lifecycle.md; working_knowledge/current/mind_map/frontend-terminal.md.
- affected units: human progress log; session state; active plan; decisions and open questions; repository findings; Task lifecycle mind map.
- expected changes: preserve the completed Task architecture record; correct stale test counts and phase-order wording; record this documentation closure as a separately auditable item.
- acceptance criteria: active knowledge matches source commits 2cfde08 and a6181df; required files retain template structure; mind-map index maps every topic file; no source or generated artifact is included.
- required tests: required header checks; stale frontend-test-count and phase-order searches; mind-map index/file consistency; `git diff --check`; commit and provenance-note readback.
- review status: passed after 2 cycles; cycle 1 found and corrected stale phase-order and frontend-test-count claims, and cycle 2 found no remaining template, source-truth, index, scope, or patch-hygiene issue.
- commit: pending

### 18.3. Persist phase outputs as task knowledge
- objective: add source-backed task knowledge artifacts produced during analysis, planning, execution, and review and advance phase state safely.
- status: pending
- files: src-tauri/src/storage.rs; src-tauri/src/commands.rs; src-tauri/src/lib.rs; relevant Rust tests.
- affected units: task phase transition API; task knowledge schema/API; phase validation and provenance linkage.
- expected changes: store immutable knowledge artifacts with task id, producing phase, kind, content, source transcript event references, and timestamps; enforce ordered phase transitions and terminal review state.
- acceptance criteria: artifacts remain task-scoped, phase provenance is explicit, invalid transitions/references fail, and phase completion is atomic with artifact writes.
- required tests: success/failure/edge cases for artifacts, provenance, ordering, retries, and task isolation.
- review status: not_started
- commit: none

### 18.4. Add the staged Task workflow to the ACP UI
- objective: expose the active Task, phase progress, and accumulated task context while preserving explicit user control over what reaches the agent.
- status: pending
- files: src/App.tsx; src/App.css; src/App.test.tsx.
- affected units: ACP prompt panel; session output; Task status/context presentation; phase actions.
- expected changes: show task identity and four phases, render phase knowledge, and provide explicit phase execution/review actions with accessible loading/error states.
- acceptance criteria: users can understand current phase and acquired knowledge; no task context is silently injected; reload restores persisted state; responsive and accessibility contracts remain intact.
- required tests: task lifecycle rendering; phase actions; restored state; error/loading states; explicit context boundary; responsive shell regression.
- review status: not_started
- commit: none

## Plan Assumptions
- One Task maps to one project-owned ACP transcript session, and the first user prompt is its immutable original prompt; project-less ACP remains a compatibility smoke path without Task persistence.
- The four canonical phases are ordered analysis, planning, execution, and review; Task creation itself provides intake/framing, and review owns final learning capture.
- Task knowledge is a separate layer from project Knowledge Units and manual Knowledge Cards, though later context assembly may select from all three explicitly.
- Phase orchestration details will be refined after first-prompt Task activation is stable.
